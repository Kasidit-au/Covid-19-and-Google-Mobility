# Covid-19-and-Google-Mobility

This repo stores my work on Covid19 and google mobility analysis. It preminarily explores google mobility data for Thailand and cross-analyze with number of covid cases in Thailand (Bangkok). It tries to explore correlation and lay the groundwork for further analysis.

Dataset used are taken from Google Mobility website, and covid information in Thailand is retrieved on governments API
